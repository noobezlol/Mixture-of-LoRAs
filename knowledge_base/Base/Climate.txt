Climate & Environment

2025 is on track to be the second or third warmest year on record, continuing an alarming streak of exceptional temperatures. The year has a 51% chance of being the second warmest and 49% chance of being third warmest, with less than 1% probability of breaking 2024's record. Global temperatures in 2025 have approximately a 9% chance of exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

Greenhouse gas concentrations and ocean heat content both reached record levels in 2024 and continued rising in 2025. Arctic sea ice extent after the winter freeze was the lowest on record, while Antarctic sea ice tracked well below average throughout the year. Ocean warming accelerates tropical storms, drives sea-level rise, and causes irreversible changes on centennial to millennial timescales.

Agricultural soils now contain approximately 23 times more microplastics than the oceans, according to a review by Murdoch University in Australia published in May 2025.
