Global Economy

Global economic growth is projected at 3.2% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, down from 3.3% in 2024. Advanced economies are expected to grow around 1.5% while emerging markets should exceed 4%. The slowdown reflects geopolitical tensions, rising protectionism, and higher trade barriers.

​

The United States is projected to grow at 2.0% in 2025 amid policy uncertainty and slower labor force growth. China's growth is expected to slow to around 4.6%, while India maintains strong momentum exceeding 6% growth. The eurozone faces subdued growth of 0.9% in 2025, improving to 1.4% in 2026 as Germany recovers.
