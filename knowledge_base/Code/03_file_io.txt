Topic: Python File Input/Output (I/O)

[Reading a Text File]
Description: The standard and safest way to read a text file is using a `with` statement, which ensures the file is automatically closed.
- Reading Line by Line: This is the most memory-efficient method for large files.
  Syntax:
  lines = []
  with open('my_file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
      for line in f:
          lines.append(line.strip())

[Writing to a Text File]
Description: Use the `with` statement with the mode 'w' for writing. This will overwrite the file if it exists. Use mode 'a' to append.
- Writing a List of Strings:
  Syntax:
  lines_to_write = ["first line", "second line"]
  with open('output.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
      for line in lines_to_write:
          f.write(line + '\\n')

[Working with JSON Files]
Description: Python's built-in `json` library is the standard for handling JSON data.
- Reading a JSON file:
  Syntax:
  import json
  with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
      data = json.load(f)
- Writing a Python dictionary to a JSON file:
  Syntax:
  import json
  my_dict = {'name': 'AI', 'version': 1.0}
  with open('output.json', 'w') as f:
      json.dump(my_dict, f, indent=4)
