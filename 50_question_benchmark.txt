Purpose: Unbiased evaluation to avoid benchmark contamination


================================================================================
CATEGORY 1: CONSTRAINT TRAPS (Questions 1-10)
================================================================================

Question 1 (Constraint):
Write a Python function `weird_sort(nums)` that sorts a list of integers, BUT odd numbers must remain in their original index positions. Only even numbers should be sorted in ascending order.

Question 2 (Constraint):
Implement a `limited_stack` class. It works like a normal stack, but if the sum of elements inside exceeds 100, the `push` operation should automatically `pop` elements from the bottom until the sum is under 100.

Question 3 (Constraint):
Write a function to reverse a string, but keep all vowels in their original positions. Example: 'design' -> 'nisedg'.

Question 4 (Constraint):
Create a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to N, but replace any prime number in the sequence with the string 'PRIME'.

Question 5 (Constraint):
Write a Python dictionary comprehension that maps numbers 1 to 10 to their squares, but ONLY if the square is an even number. If the square is odd, map it to 0.

Question 6 (Constraint):
Write a function that takes a list of strings and sorts them based on the *third* letter of each word. If a word is shorter than 3 letters, put it at the end.

Question 7 (Constraint):
Implement a counter that counts from 1 to 100, but skips numbers that contain the digit '3' (e.g., 3, 13, 30-39).

Question 8 (Constraint):
Write a function `merge_alternating(list1, list2)` that merges two lists by taking elements alternately. If one list runs out, reverse the remaining elements of the other list and append them.

Question 9 (Constraint):
Create a class `OneTimeDict`. It behaves like a dictionary, but once a key is read (accessed), that key is automatically deleted.

Question 10 (Constraint):
Write a function that finds the maximum number in a list, but you are NOT allowed to use `max()`, `sorted()`, `sort()`, or any comparison operators like `>` or `<`. (Hint: use subtraction and absolute values).

================================================================================
CATEGORY 2: FORMAT TORTURE (Questions 11-20)
================================================================================

Question 11 (Format):
Write a Python Hello World script. However, you MUST NOT use the string 'Hello World' directly. You must construct it using ASCII character codes and the `chr()` function.

Question 12 (Format):
Generate a Python function to calculate factorial. BUT, the entire function body must be written on a single line using lambda functions. No `def` allowed.

Question 13 (Format):
Write a standard binary search function. However, all variable names must be fruits (e.g., 'apple' for left, 'banana' for right).

Question 14 (Format):
Create a JSON object representing a user profile. The keys must be 'u_id', 'u_name', and 'u_age'. Do NOT write any Python code, just output the raw JSON string inside markdown code blocks.

Question 15 (Format):
Write a Python comment block describing the Theory of Relativity. Do not write any executable code.

Question 16 (Format):
Write a SQL query to select users, but format the SQL query as a single Python string variable named `sql_query`. Do not explain the query.

Question 17 (Format):
Write a Python function to add two numbers, but you must use a nested function architecture (a closure) to achieve it.

Question 18 (Format):
Output the CSS code to center a div, but you must use Grid, not Flexbox. Provide ONLY the CSS.

Question 19 (Format):
Write a Python list comprehension that produces the first 10 even numbers. However, you must wrap the list comprehension in a `try-except` block within the function.

Question 20 (Format):
Write a bash script to list files, but all comments in the script must be written in French.

================================================================================
CATEGORY 3: REAL WORLD MESSY (Questions 21-30)
================================================================================

Question 21 (Real World):
I have a log string: '[ERROR] 2023-10-05 User:admin caused:Timeout'. Write a regex to extract the severity (ERROR), date, username, and error type into a dictionary.

Question 22 (Real World):
Write a Pandas one-liner to filter a DataFrame `df`. Keep rows where column 'A' is greater than 10 OR column 'B' is less than 5, AND column 'C' is not Null.

Question 23 (Real World):
Write a python script to rename all files in a folder. If a file is 'image.jpg', rename it to 'img_001.jpg', 'img_002.jpg', etc. It must handle padding zeros correctly based on the total file count.

Question 24 (Real World):
Implement a 'rate_limiter' decorator in Python. It should allow a function to be called only 5 times every 10 seconds. If exceeded, raise an exception.

Question 25 (Real World):
Write a function to validate a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm.

Question 26 (Real World):
Given a list of dirty phone numbers like ['123-456-7890', '(123) 456 7890', '123.456.7890'], write a function to normalize them all to '1234567890'.

Question 27 (Real World):
Parse a CSV string manually without using the `csv` library. The string deals with quoted fields containing commas. Example line: `1, "Apple, Red", $1.00`.

Question 28 (Real World):
Write a function that takes a URL and returns the domain name (e.g., 'https://www.google.com/search' -> 'google.com'). Handle subdomains correctly.

Question 29 (Real World):
Implement a simple exponential backoff strategy for a failing network request using a while loop.

Question 30 (Real World):
Write a function to convert a nested JSON object into a flat dictionary where keys are separated by dots (e.g., {'a': {'b': 1}} -> {'a.b': 1}).

================================================================================
CATEGORY 4: ALGORITHMIC & CREATIVE (Questions 31-40)
================================================================================

Question 31 (Creative):
Write a Python script to print a pyramid of stars of height 5. It must be centered.

Question 32 (Creative):
Write code to generate a random maze using Depth First Search (DFS). Represent the maze using '#' for walls and ' ' for paths.

Question 33 (Creative):
Simulate a text-based traffic light system. It should loop forever, printing 'RED', waiting 3s, 'GREEN', waiting 3s, 'YELLOW', waiting 1s.

Question 34 (Creative):
Write a Python class `VirtualPet`. It has `hunger` and `energy`. Methods: `feed()` decreases hunger, `play()` decreases energy. If energy < 0, it sleeps.

Question 35 (Creative):
Write a function that takes a sentence and prints it out vertically, like a banner.

Question 36 (Algo):
Implement the 'Sieve of Eratosthenes' to find all primes up to N, but optimize it to use a bitarray instead of a list of booleans for memory efficiency.

Question 37 (Algo):
Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams, but you must do it in O(n) time and O(1) space (assuming fixed alphabet size).

Question 38 (Algo):
Implement a 'MinStack' that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time O(1).

Question 39 (Algo):
Write a function to find the longest substring without repeating characters in a string.

Question 40 (Algo):
Implement a basic version of the 'cd' (change directory) command logic. Given a current path and a command (like '../abc/./def'), resolve the new path.

================================================================================
CATEGORY 5: SECURITY & EDGE CASES (Questions 41-50)
================================================================================

Question 41 (Security):
Write a SQL query construction to select a user by ID, but protect it against SQL Injection without using an ORM. Use parameterized queries logic.

Question 42 (Security):
Write a Python function to safely delete a file. It must check if the file exists and ensure the path is not outside the allowed directory (prevent directory traversal).

Question 43 (Edge Case):
Write a function to calculate the average of a list. Handle the edge cases: empty list, list with None values, and list with strings.

Question 44 (Edge Case):
Implement division of two numbers, but handle division by zero gracefully by returning None, and ensure floating point precision issues are minimized.

Question 45 (Edge Case):
Write a function to parse a date string 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Handle invalid dates like '2023-02-30' (February 30th) without crashing.

Question 46 (Security):
Write a function to generate a secure random token of 32 bytes, encoded in URL-safe Base64.

Question 47 (Edge Case):
Merge two dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value should become a list containing both values. Handle cases where the original value is already a list.

Question 48 (Security):
Sanitize a user input string to remove any potential HTML tags to prevent XSS attacks.

Question 49 (Algo):
Write a function to detect if a binary tree is balanced. Return True or False.

Question 50 (Creative):
Write a Python script that simulates a simple ATM state machine (Idle -> PIN -> Menu -> Withdraw -> Dispense). Use a while loop and user input.
